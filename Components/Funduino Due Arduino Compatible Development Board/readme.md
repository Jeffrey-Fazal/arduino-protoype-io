# Specs:
The Arduino Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU. It is the first Arduino board based on a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button. The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable. The Due is compatible with all 3.3V Arduino shields.

Note: This board is a compatible clone version of the original Arduino Due.

Features
A 32-bit core, that allows operations on 4 bytes wide data within a single CPU clock.
CPU Clock at 84MHz.
96KB of SRAM.
512KB of Flash memory for code.
A DMA controller that can relieve the CPU from doing memory intensive tasks.
